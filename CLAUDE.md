# Project Instructions for Claude

## Git Workflow

- Use `git switch -c` to create branches (not `git checkout -b`)
- Create a GitHub issue first before starting work
- Branch naming: 1-3 short words with issue number appended (e.g., `consent-groups-42`)
- Commit messages: single line only, no multi-line messages
